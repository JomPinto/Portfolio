    "This dataset is based from the annual landline and cellphone health related survey conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This survey collects data for over 400,000 U.S. residents regarding their health conditions, health-related behaviours and preventive services available to them. Originally, the survey was conducted through telephone and cellphone but with the emerging changes in culture and technology they also incorporated additional methods in collecting data. This includes conducting the survey online and by sending a packaged that includes a paper version of the survey. For more information regarding the data colletction and research results you can visit the [BRFSS Web site](https://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=cdc_data_brfss&referrer=data_set_page).\n",

    "Originally, we planned to used the original dataset from BRFSS but since it consist of mroe than 400,000 observations and 330 variables the notebook can't handle the size of the dataset. The dataset we used called [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv) is a cleaned dataset based from the 2015 BRFSS survey available in Kaggle. The process for the data cleaning is available in this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset-notebook). This dataset is composed of 253,680 responses which primarily focuses on data regarding diabetes and its health indicators. There are 22 variables including the target variable diabetes. This sample is composed of randomly selected U.S. residents from each state by using random digit dialing sampling. This sampling method includes unlisted respondents in the phone book. Thus our conclusion and insight would only be applicable to U.S. residents.\n",

    "A total of 22 variables was recorded in this dataset. These variables includes our target variable which is diabetes (whether the respondetns has a diabets, prediabets or none), respondent's health-related risk behaviors, and health indicators. Note that since the survey was primarily through landline and cellphone, its easier to record using numbers. Thus, each categorical data was represented using integers in the dateset. The description for the variables used was explained below. "

From this, the boxplot shows us that those who are not diabtec have lower BMI values compared to those who are prediabetic and diabetic. Furthermore, we can see from the boxplot that there are so many extreme values from each categories. We note that these values are not outliers since it is possible  for an individual to have to have a high BMI but doesn't have a diabetes. It is also possible that a person's with low BMI has a diabetes. To have a much more clearer view we take a look at the summary of statistics."

    "As we can see from the summary statisitcs, people with diabetes has the highest average of BMI followed by people with prediabetes. Moreover, since the mean and median is almost equal the distribution for the data is almost normally distributed (no skewness). With these, we see that people with higher BMI tends to be more prone in having diabetes. But we can't still answer our first question *\"Does people with high BMI count have a greater probability to have diabetes?\"* since we don't know if the difference is statistically significant. A hypthesis testing is necessary in order to answer this. With this, we came up our first research question **Is there a difference with the BMI of those that are diabetic to those who are not diabetic?**"

    "Our next question *\"Does a person's income have a relation to their diabetic status?\"* focuses on the relationship between an individuals Income (`Income`) and their Diabetic Status (`Diabetes`). For this analysis, the researchers want to determine if there is any sign that diabetes, or the lack thereof, is related to the income of a person. To visualize this, the researchers will use a histogram that depicts the count of those that have diabetes, prediabetes, and nodiabetes, organized in relation to their income."

    "1. From the [recent fact sheet of WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight), 1.9 billion adults were considered overwieght and 650 million from these were considered obese. The number is almost tripled from the record in the year 1975. The number of obese and overweight adults continues to grow. Since obesity is preventable it is important to know if there's a signifianct difference between a person's BMI with respect to their diabetic status. This could help us in preventing and lowering the increasing number of diabetic person.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another [fact sheet report made by WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) shows that on the year 2016, about 28% of adults do not meet the global recommendation of physical activity per week. Moreover, with the pandemic going it is much harder to become physicaly active with all this restrictions. Knowing the relationship between a person's physical activty and diabetic status might emphaize the importance of being more physicaly active. "
