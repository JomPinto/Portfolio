## Abstract:

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The factors that cause mortality are plenty, some mortality were caused by diseases while some are accidents. That being said, the purpose of this paper is to investigate some factors that affect the mortality rate in the Philippines. However, these factors are only limited to facilities and workers, such as health facilities/centers, Health workers/care providers, specifically speaking there were twelve variables used in this study. The data that was used in this research had come from the Department of Health 2019 annual report in their Field Health Services Information System. The data that was used were compiled per region in the Philippines, hence this study will only have exactly seventeen observations. The researchers had used multiple regression analysis to correlate these factors and the mortality rate in the Philippines. After using data elimination, stepwise selection, it was concluded that among the eleven explanatory variables that were used, three of them showed significant relationship with mortality rates, furthermore these significant variables had an inverse relationship with the mortality rate.
